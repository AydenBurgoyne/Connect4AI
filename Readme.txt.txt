Purpose:
This program is a simple connect4 ai that I developed for my algorithms assignment, the program works with the .jar file that coordinates the game.


How To Run:
Java level must be 1.8. The reason being is because I can't recompile the .jar file as it was provided with the assignment.

To run type java -jar connect_4_coordinator.jar e0 as1
This will run the ai against itself and display the game moves in the terminal.
